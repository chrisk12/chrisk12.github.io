## Welcome to Chris Kincaid's ePortfolio for CS-499

  This page was created to showcase my work complete during my time in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University. 
There are three different types of artifacts being showcased during my time SNHU. Each artifact is from a different point of time during the Computer Science program, and 
shows what different skills I have had the pleasure of learning while enrolled here. Some examples of what you will see is C++, Java, software tests, MongoDB, Python, and 
different software developing techniques. I have learned so much during my time here at SNHU and I am excited to put my work to use! Each artifacts comes with its own narrative to describe how and why it was created, and during what time. Thank you!
